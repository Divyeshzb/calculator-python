Scenario 1: Verify the correct multiplication of two positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_of_positive_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly multiplies two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as function does not depend on any global state or external dependencies. 
  Act: Call the multiplication function with two positive integers as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is equal to the product of these two integers.
Validation:
  The test checks basic correct functionality. The function's primary purpose is to return the product of two numbers, and this test ensures it successfully does so with positive integers.

Scenario 2: Verify the multiplication of zero and any number
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_with_zero
  Description: This test validates proper handling of zero, as per the multiplication property "any number multiplied by zero equals zero". 
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call multiplication function with zero and any other number as parameters.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  This tests a fundamental property of multiplication. Ensuring that the function handles this correctly is crucial for accuracy in any mathematical application.

Scenario 3: Verify the correct multiplication of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_of_negative_numbers
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly multiplies two negative numbers and returns a positive result.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call the multiplication function with two negative integers as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is positive and equals to the product of the absolute values of these two integers.
Validation:
  Mathematically, the multiplication of two negative numbers should result in a positive. This test scenario ensures that this mathematical rule holds true in the function's implementation.

Scenario 4: Verify the multiplication of a positive and negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_of_positive_and_negative_numbers
  Description: This test checks that the multiplication of a positive number and a negative number yields a negative result.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call the multiplication function with a positive number and a negative number as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is negative and equals to the product of the absolute values of these two numbers but negative.
Validation:
  The multiplication of a negative number and a positive number should return a negative result. This test checks this key mathematical rule, ensuring the accuracy of the function.

Scenario 5: Verify multiplication in floating-point context
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_with_floating_point_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly multiplies numbers with decimal points.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required.
  Act: Call the function multiplication with floating-point numbers as input parameters.
  Assert: The returned value should be approximately equal to the product of the two numbers, accepting a slight deviation due to floating point precision issues.
Validation:
  The function should be able to handle and return correct results not only for integer multiplication but also for floating-point number multiplication. This is critical for any software that involves arithmetic calculations with decimal numbers.
