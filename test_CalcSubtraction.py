Scenario 1: Validate the subtraction of two positive numbers.
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_positive_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the business logic of the function subtraction accurately computes the difference between two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize two positive numbers as num1 and num2.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is equal to num1 - num2.
Validation: 
  It's a basic test under normal circumstances where the two numbers are positive. The function's expected behavior under this common condition verifies its efficacy in real use.

Scenario 2: Validate the subtraction of a positive number and a negative number.
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_positive_negative_numbers
  Description: This test will confirm that the subtraction function correctly calculates the difference when num1 is a positive number and num2 is a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize num1 as a positive number, and num2 as a negative number.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned value matches the expected difference.
Validation: 
  Subtracting a negative number from a positive number is a valid mathematical operation. Therefore, this test ensures that the function handles this scenario correctly.

Scenario 3: Validate the subtraction of zeros.
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_zeros
  Description: This test will determine if the subtraction function appropriately computes the difference when either num1, num2, or both are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize num1 and/or num2 as zero.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function, passing num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the result is as expected.
Validation: 
  It is important that the function subtracts zero correctly as it's both a possible use case and a requirement of the subtraction operation in mathematics.

Scenario 4: Validate subtraction when both input numbers are equal.
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_equal_numbers
  Description: This test aims to ascertain whether the subtraction function returns zero when getting two equal numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize num1 and num2 to the same value.
  Act: Call the subtraction function with num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is zero.
Validation: 
  This test ensures that the function follows the basic mathematical rule that subtracting a number from itself should yield zero.

Scenario 5: Validate subtraction with floating-point numbers.
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_floating_numbers
  Description: The test is intended to confirm that the subtraction method consistently handles decimal (float) input numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize num1 and num2 with floating-point values.
  Act: Run the subtraction function using num1 and num2 as parameters.
  Assert: Confirm the returned result matches the expected difference allowing for acceptable minor discrepancies due to floating-point precision.
Validation: 
  This confirms the function serves a user/program's need to carry out subtraction operations on floating-point numbers, not just integers, thereby broadening its utility and correctness.
