  This test checks the function's ability to handle the addition of large negative integers and small negative floating-point numbers, ensuring it maintains precision and correctness.

---

### Scenario 7: Commutative property of addition
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_addition_commutative_property
  **Description:** Verify that the addition function is commutative, i.e., `addition(num1, num2)` is equal to `addition(num2, num1)`.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize `num1` to any integer, e.g., `5`, and `num2` to another integer, e.g., `10`.
  **Act:** Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`, and then with `num2` and `num1`.
  **Assert:** The results of both calls should be equal.

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the addition function adheres to the commutative property of addition, which is fundamental to its correctness.

---

### Scenario 8: Associative property of addition
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_addition_associative_property
  **Description:** Verify that the addition function is associative, i.e., `addition(addition(num1, num2), num3)` is equal to `addition(num1, addition(num2, num3))`.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize `num1`, `num2`, and `num3` to any integers, e.g., `3`, `5`, and `7`.
  **Act:** Call the `addition` function in both associative manners.
  **Assert:** The results of both calls should be equal.

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the addition function adheres to the associative property of addition, which is essential for its correctness in complex calculations.

---

### Scenario 9: Addition of very small positive and negative floating-point numbers
**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_addition_small_positive_and_negative_floating_point
  **Description:** Verify that adding very small positive and negative floating-point numbers returns the correct sum.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize `num1` to a very small positive floating-point number, e.g., `1e-10`, and `num2` to a very small negative floating-point number, e.g., `-1e-10`.
  **Act:** Call the `addition` function with `num1` and `num2`.
  **Assert:** The result should be `0`.

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function can handle the addition of very small floating-point numbers and correctly compute their sum, even when they cancel each other out.
