### Scenario 1: Test Addition of Two Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive integers, e.g., 3 and 5.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 8.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles basic positive integer inputs correctly, which is a fundamental requirement of addition.

### Scenario 2: Test Addition of Two Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative integers, e.g., -3 and -5.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is -8.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles negative integer inputs, which is crucial for complete arithmetic functionality.

### Scenario 3: Test Addition of a Positive and a Negative Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_positive_and_negative_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a positive integer and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare one positive integer and one negative integer, e.g., 7 and -2.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 5.
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle mixed-sign inputs, which is important for real-world arithmetic operations.

### Scenario 4: Test Addition of Zero and a Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_zero_and_positive_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds zero and a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare zero and a positive integer, e.g., 0 and 5.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that adding zero to a number returns the number itself, which is a basic property of addition.

### Scenario 5: Test Addition of Zero and a Negative Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_zero_and_negative_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds zero and a negative integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare zero and a negative integer, e.g., 0 and -5.

  TestName: test_addition_two_large_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two large integers, e.g., 1000000 and 2000000.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these integers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 3000000.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle large integer inputs without issues, which is important for scalability and performance.

### Scenario 7: Test Addition of Two Floating-Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_two_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two floating-point numbers, e.g., 1.5 and 2.5.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 4.0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle floating-point arithmetic, which is essential for accurate numerical computations.

### Scenario 8: Test Addition of Integer and Floating-Point Number
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_integer_and_floating_point_number
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds an integer and a floating-point number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an integer and a floating-point number, e.g., 3 and 2.5.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 5.5.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can correctly add mixed-type numeric inputs, which is important for flexibility in numerical operations.

### Scenario 9: Test Addition of Very Small Floating-Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_very_small_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds very small floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two very small floating-point numbers, e.g., 1e-10 and 2e-10.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 3e-10.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle very small floating-point numbers, which is important for precision in scientific computations.

### Scenario 10: Test Addition of a Large Number and a Small Number
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_and_small_number
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds a large number and a small number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large number and a small number, e.g., 1e10 and 1.
  Act: Call the `addition` function with these numbers.
  Assert: Check that the result is 1e10 + 1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle significant differences in magnitude between inputs, which is important for numerical stability.

By covering these scenarios, we ensure that the `addition` function is robust and performs correctly across a wide range of typical and edge case inputs.
